# ML Pipeline Versioning System

This project demonstrates a DevOps-ready ML pipeline with versioning for code, data, and models using Git, DVC, and MLflow.

## Tools Used

- **Git**: Code and pipeline versioning
- **DVC**: Data versioning
- **MLflow**: Experiment and model tracking
- **CI/CD**: Example with GitHub Actions

## Workflow

1. Code and pipeline scripts are versioned with Git.
2. Data is versioned and tracked with DVC.
3. Experiments and models are tracked with MLflow.
4. CI/CD pipeline automates training, evaluation, and deployment steps.

## Quickstart

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Initialize DVC: `dvc init`
3. Run the pipeline: `python pipeline.py`
4. Track experiments: `mlflow ui`
